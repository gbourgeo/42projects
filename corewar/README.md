# COREWAAAAR !!!
_Binary MMA_

## PROJECT
Corewar is a very particular game.
It consists of gathering around a __"virtual machine"__ __"players"__, which will load __"champions"__ who are going to
fight using _"processes"_, in order, among other things, to make people say from them that they are _"alive"_.

Processes run sequentially within the same virtual machine, and the same memory space. They can therefore, among other things, write each other on others in order to corrupt each other, to force others to perform instructions that hurt them.

The game ends when no more processes are alive. At that moment, the
winner is the last player to be reported as "alive".

## ASSEMBLER
_This is the program that will compile your champions and translate them of the language in which you are going to write them (the assembler) to a "bytecode", to know a machine code that will be directly interpreted by the virtual machine._

## VIRTUAL MACHINE
_This is the "arena" in which the champions will run. It offers many features, all useful for fighting champions. It goes without saying that it makes it possible to execute several processes simultaneously; we asks you for an arena, not a simulator of one-man show._

## CHAMPION
**.name** "Clownito"

**.comment** "Los Santos del Pablos muchos Clownitos del tacos y nachos ranchos con Sergio Ramos"
